# Spawner Tweaks

Changes the game logic to allow modifying altars, chests, item stands, pickables, smelters, spawn points and spawners.

Install on all clients and on the server (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

# Usage

This mod only provides game logic.

To modify behavior, you need [World Edit Commands](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/World_Edit_Commands/).

# Config

- Components: Altars, pickables, spawn points and spawners can be attached to any object.
- Boss altars: Boss altar properties can be overridden.
- Chests: Chest properties can be overridden.
- Item stands: Item stand properties can be overridden.
- Pickables: Pickable properties can be overridden.
- Spawn points: Spawn point properties can be overridden.
- Smelters: Smelter properties can be overridden.
- Spawners: Spawner properties can be overridden.
- No spawn point suppression (one time): One time spawn points can't be suppressed with player base structures (even if configured to be respawning).
- No spawn point suppression (respawning): Respawning spawn points can't be suppressed with player base structures (even if configured to be one time). This is off by default because it can affect vanilla game play.
